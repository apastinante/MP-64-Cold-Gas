# MP-64-Cold-Gas
Design of a cold gas system for Micro-Propulsion 

The code first creates the requirements for delta-V and the requirements for the dimensions and mass are set manually. Then the design space is explored and plotted based on the feasibility. Finally, the minimum mass designs are selected and printed.
